## Topic Networking

Computer networking is the practice of connecting various gadgets to proportion resources and information. This can contain routers, switches, hubs, and modems, each serving exceptional features in handling facts transmission.

Networking gadgets consist of:

 Router: Used to connect exceptional networks together.

Switch: Facilitates connections inside a local community.

Hub: Connects a couple of gadgets inside a LAN, working primarily on the physical layer.

Modem: Converts digital facts from computers into alerts suitable for transmission over verbal exchange traces.

The arrangement and connections of computer systems in a network, called topology, decide how facts flows. Common network topologies consist of Point-to-Point, Star, Mesh, Hybrid, Bus, Ring, Tree, and Daisy Chain.

Protocols act as a not unusual language for computer systems to speak. These protocols allow unique varieties of networks:

 WAN (Wide Area Network): Covers a big location, typically known as the internet.

LAN (Local Area Network): Covers a restrained region like houses, colleges, or workplaces.

WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network): Utilizes WiFi for inner network connections.

VPN (Virtual Private Network): Allows multiple network web sites to connect with one LAN, which include web site-to-web site VPNs, remote get admission to VPNs, and SSL VPNs.

Proxy servers act as mediators in network connections, with kinds together with Dedicated Proxy, Reverse Proxy, and Transparent Proxy.

Two common networking models are the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) Model:

 OSI Model: Conceptualizes verbal exchange systems into seven layers, including the Physical, Data-link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application layers.

 TCP/IP Model: Manages statistics packet switching and delivery on the internet, such as the Link, Internet, Transport, and Application layers.

The OSI and TCP/IP fashions, although advanced independently, align closely. The Link layer in TCP/IP corresponds to the Physical and Data Link layers in OSI. The Network layer in OSI matches the Internet layer in TCP/IP, at the same time as the Transport layers align at once. The Application layer in TCP/IP encompasses capabilities from the Session, Presentation, and Application layers in OSI.
