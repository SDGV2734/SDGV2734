In this blog I will be sharing what we did our sixth flipped class. We went through Nonrelational Database along with their advantages, disadvantages and its applications. Before we move further lets learn about NoSQL, The data in Database are stored in tabular form but in case NoSQL the data are stored in non_tabular form and NoSQl stand for No only SQL.

It is a nonrelational database where data are not  stored in tabular form, instead it uses documentsto store data in the data base. The document database   store's data in JSON(JavaScript object Notation), BSON or XML documents
