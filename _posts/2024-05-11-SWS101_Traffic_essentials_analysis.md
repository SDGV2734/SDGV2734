### Introduction

Network security involves the protection of computer networks and their infrastructure from unauthorized access, misusing, modification, or denial of service. It encompasses various technologies, processes, and practices designed to defend networks, data, and systems from cyber threats.

Network traffic analysis is the process of monitoring and analyzing network traffic to detect and respond to security threats, performance issues, and operational anomalies. It involves capturing and inspecting data packets as they move across a network to gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of network traffic.
